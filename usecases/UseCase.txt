Generate BDD Tests (in Gherkin format) for the given URL
Problem Statement
You are required to design and implement an AI-based automation
solution that dynamically generates Gherkin-style testing scenarios for
websites containing hovering elements (for example: navigation menus,
image overlays, tooltip popups, or dropdown lists revealed on hover).

 Objective
The system should :
1. Accept a website URL as input and
2. Automatically:
a. Detect and analyze hoverable elements across the given page (not
limited to menus).
b. Simulate hover actions using browser automation. (e.g., Playwright).
c. Identify elements or links that become visible as a result of the
hover interaction.
d. Identify any popup/modal behaviors triggered by actions.
Generate clean, well-formatted Gherkin scenarios describing how a tester
should validate:
- The visibility and behavior of hover-based elements.
- The clickability and redirection (if applicable) of revealed links or
elements.

⚠️ Important Note:
The solution must be fully dynamic and autonomous.
It should not rely on any hardcoded selectors, labels, or element
identifiers.
Instead, it should analyze the webpage structure and behaviors to
understand interactions at runtime.
It should work seamlessly across different types of modern, dynamic
websites — not just static pages or predefined DOM structures.

Functional Expectations / Requirements
 Input: A single website URL.
 Output: Automatically generated Gherkin .feature file (or console
output) containing two dynamic test cases for that URL:
a. Validation of popup/overlay behavior (if found).
b. Validation of hover-based interactions (e.g., dropdowns or hover
menus).
Tech Stack Requirements
Development must be done in Python. Refer the following suggested
technologies. But you are free to use any other technical stack as well, as
long as it is Python based solution.

Suggested Technical Stack

Layer Recommended Tools

Browser Automation Playwright / Selenium
HTML Parsing / DOM
Analysis

BeautifulSoup, lxml

LLM Reasoning OpenAI GPT-4/GPT-5, Gemini, or Ollama

(local)

Agentic Frameworks Autogen / CrewAI / LangGraph / MCP
Backend API FastAPI
UI (Optional) Streamlit
Storage SQLite or JSON for caching DOM metadata
Output Format .feature files (Gherkin)

Candidate may use one or multiple of the above frameworks as part of
the solution.
Use of open-source libraries or projects is allowed if appropriately cited
or integrated.

Example Website
Input URL’s:
1. https://www.tivdak.com/patient-stories/

2. https://www.nike.com/in/
3. https://www.apple.com/in/
Expected Example Gherkin Scenarios
Normal Test Steps Gherkin BDD Format
Test 1:
1. Goto the url
https://www.tivdak.com/patient-
stories/
2. Click the button called “Learn
More”
3. A pop up will appear with the
title saying “You are now leaving
tivdak.com”
4. Click the cancel button
5. Click the button called “Learn
More”
6. A pop up will appear with the
title saying “You are now leaving
tivdak.com”
7. Click the continue button
8. Verify the url has changed to
“https://alishasjourney.com/”

Feature: Validate &quot;Learn More&quot;
pop-up functionality
Scenario: Verify the cancel button
in the &quot;You are now leaving
tivdak.com&quot; pop-up 
Given the user is on the
&quot;https://www.tivdak.com/patient-
stories/&quot; page 
When the user clicks the &quot;Learn
More&quot; button 
Then a pop-up should appear with
the title &quot;You are now leaving
tivdak.com&quot; 
And the user clicks the &quot;Cancel&quot;
button 
Then the pop-up should close and
the user should remain on the same
page
When the user clicks the &quot;Learn
More&quot; button 
Then a pop-up should appear with
the title &quot;You are now leaving
tivdak.com&quot; 
And the user clicks the &quot;Continue&quot;
button 
the same page
Then the page URL should change
to &quot;https://alishasjourney.com/&quot;

Test 2:
1. Go to the URL
https://www.tivdak.com/patient-
stories/
2. Hover over the navigation menu
“About Tivdak”
3. A drop-down will appear
4. Click on the link “What is
Tivdak?”
5. Verify the URL has changed to
“https://www.tivdak.com/about-
tivdak/”

Feature: Validate navigation menu
functionality
Scenario: Verify navigation from
&quot;Patient Stories&quot; to &quot;What is
Tivdak&quot; page 
Given the user is on the
&quot;https://www.tivdak.com/patient-
stories/&quot; page 
When the user hovers over the
navigation menu &quot;About Tivdak&quot; 
And clicks the link &quot;What is
Tivdak?&quot; from the dropdown 
Then the page URL should change
to
&quot;https://www.tivdak.com/about-
tivdak/&quot;

Deliverables:
a. Source code (well-structured and modular)
b. Push the complete solution to a public GitHub repository and share
the link
c. Include a well-structured README file with setup, usage
instructions, and requirements.txt
d. Provide a demo video (max. 7 minutes) showcasing the solution
flow and output and key code logic.
e. Sample output Gherkin file (e.g., hover_tests.feature) or console
output
f. The solution should cover both logics — detecting hover elements
and popup elements.
